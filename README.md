Different Machine Learning Algorithms like logistic regression,k-Nearest Neighbours,Linear Discriminant Analysis,Classification and Regression Trees, Gaussian Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines were applied on the well known IRIS dataset. The models were implemented using sci-kit learn standard libraries and K-fold cross evaluation was done to train the models. Then the best performing model was chosen and applied on a held out validation set and its performance was measured.
